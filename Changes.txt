	buffers from&to ethernet controller
	- IOCHRDY is now handled correctly in ethernet.c

	- fixed Ethernet.c so that data direction registers are not set
	up with #defines but with literasls.
	
11.06.2003
	- fixed all possible problems with shifting (dns.c, ip.c)
	- fixed some flaws in DHCP client

	- fixed possible #include dependency problem in globalvariables.h (
		declaration of extern structs without knowing their exact
		structure)
	
12.05.2003
	- bug in dns.c that comes up with certain buggy C compilers fixed (
		promoting implicitly 8-bit values only to 16-bit, not 32)
	
29.04.2003
	- bug with incorred checksum calculation when receiving UDP broadcast
	  fixed
	  
06.04.2003

04.03.2003
	- Incorrect sochandle definitions in tcp.c fixed
	- strlen bug in system.c fixed

03.02.2003

	- for loop in bootp.c modified slightly so it compiles with
	  all C compilers

25.01.2003
	OpenTCP version 1.0.1
	- some erorrs in documentation regarding TCP timeout values were fixed
	- error in vectors.c where non-existing serial.h is included corrected
