 *	\version 1.0
 *	\date 10.7.2002
 * 	
 *	This file holds #defines of data types used in the OpenTCP
 *	sources so that recompiling for another MCU is easier even
 *	when the other MCU is using different size default values.
 *
 *	Constants that need to be defined in this file for every 
 *	microcontroller and/or compiler are:
 *		\li BYTE	- unsigned 8 bit value
 *		\li WORD	- unsigned 16 bit value
 *		\li LWORD 	- unsigned 32 bit value
 *		\li UINT8	- unsigned 8 bit value
 *		\li INT8	- signed 8 bit value
 *		\li UINT16	- unsigned 16 bit value
 *		\li INT16	- signed 16 bit value
 *		\li UINT32	- unsigned 32 bit value
 *		\li INT32	- signed 32 bit value
