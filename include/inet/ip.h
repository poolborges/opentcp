/** \struct ip_frame ip.h
 *	\brief IP datagram header fields
 *
 *	This structure is used for holding information about various fields
 *	of the IPv4 header. In addition to standard IP header, buf_index
 *	variable has been added to store the information about the buffer
 *	address in the Ethernet controller from where upper layer protocols (
 *	such as TCP, UDP or some other) can start reading their data. This
 *	is initialized by invoking NETWORK_RECEIVED_INITIALIZE macro with 
 *	appropriate buf_index value.
 *
 *	For detailed explanation of the IPv4 header fields refer to RFC791.
